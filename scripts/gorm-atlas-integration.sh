Next steps:
1. Disable GORM AutoMigrate in production
2. Use Atlas for all future schema changes
3. Keep GORM models as source of truth
4. Generate Atlas migrations from model changes

ðŸš€ Implementation Strategy:

1. **Development Workflow:**
   - Keep GORM models as schema definition
   - Generate Atlas migrations from model changes
   - Test migrations in development environment

2. **Production Deployment:**
   - Use Atlas for production migrations
   - Automated CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Safe rollback capabilities

3. **Future Schema Changes:**
   - Update GORM models
   - Generate migration: atlas migrate diff --env dev
   - Review and test migration
   - Deploy via Atlas in CI/CD

echo "âœ… Atlas + GORM integration ready!"
